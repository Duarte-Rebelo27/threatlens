# ThreatLens

ThreatLens is a personal project that aims to create a lightweight intrusion detection dashboard that parses server logs and detects suspicious activity patterns such as brute force attempts and sensitive endpoint access.

This is a project that I am working on to develop my cybersecurity skills!

## Features (WIP)
- Log parsing
- Brute force detection
- Suspicious path detection
